                       <h2>PERSONAL PROFILE:</h2>
                            <p>Science and technology have been interests of mine since high school physics class back in the 90's
                                Doing jobs that are meticulous and creative, that require thinking and strategy, are what I enjoy.
                                I'm disciplined and commited. You'll see in my work history I keep with my careers for long periods of time.
                                My references will be able to give some insight on how I function within a team, too. Which I do well.
                            </p>

                        <p>I aspire to find work that feels less like work and more like a hobby or interest I can get lost in 
                            Working at a pace where I don't burn out is quite important to me since I have been in jobs
                            where that happened.
                            Also, I want to be a chef and make delicious food. Which reminds me... I'm hungry.
